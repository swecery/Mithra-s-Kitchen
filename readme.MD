### Installation Guide

This section details how to set up and configure your Django project in a local environment using PostgreSQL.

To successfully run this project, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

* Python (version 3.8 or higher recommended)
* pip (Python package manager)
* PostgreSQL (Database server)

#### Using a virtual environment for Python projects helps manage dependencies effectively. To create a virtual environment, run the following commands in your terminal: 
```
bash
python -m venv venv
```
#### To activate the virtual environment:
* For macOS and Linux: 
```
bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
* For Windows:
```
bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Installing Required Python Packages:
```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Firstly, to use a PostgreSQL database in your project, you need to install the psycopg2 package. psycopg2 is an adapter written in Python for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. You can manage your database operations in your Django project using this adapter.

#### Installing Psycopg2: 
```
bash
pip install psycopg2
```
If you prefer a lighter installation, you can use the psycopg2-binary package:
```
bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

#### Install PostgreSQL (macOS)
If you have Homebrew installed, you can easily install PostgreSQL by opening a terminal and running:
```
bash
brew install postgresql
```
#### Starting PostgreSQL:
After installation, you can start PostgreSQL using:
```
bash
brew services start postgresql
```

## Running the App Locally with VS Code Terminal

1. ### Open VS Code Terminal:
   - Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Open the terminal by navigating to `View > TerminalÂ´.

2. ### Login to Heroku:
   - Ensure you are logged into your Heroku account by running:
     ```sh
     heroku login
     ```
   - Follow the instructions to complete the login process.

3. ### Navigate to Your Project Directory:
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory. For example:
     ```sh
     cd /Users/YourMacUsername/Projects/mithraskitchen
     ```

4. ### Run the App on Heroku:
   - Use the following command to collect static files and run your app on Heroku:
     ```sh
     heroku run python manage.py collectstatic
     ```

By following these steps, you can manage your Heroku application directly from the VS Code terminal.
